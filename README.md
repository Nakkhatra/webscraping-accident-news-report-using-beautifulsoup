# webscraping-accident-news-report-using-beautifulsoup

In this repo, I have scraped road accident news reports data (Headlines, urls etc) from the website of a news paper named the Daily Observer Bangladesh, using python and beautifulsoup. Later I did some cleaning on the scraped data with regular expressions and also separated the rows with/without injuy news. 

Later I used this dataset to extract the locations of road accidents in Bangladesh, geocoded the locations (Got longitudes and latitudes) using geopy and created an interactive heatmap on Bangladesh map using mapbox (For this geocoding part, I have uploaded my code in a separate repo: https://github.com/Nakkhatra/extracting-geocodes-from-location-using-geopy-and-interactive-heatmap-with-mapbox.git
